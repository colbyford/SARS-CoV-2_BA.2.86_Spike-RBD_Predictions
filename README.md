## Abstract

The emergence of the Omicron sublineage of SARS-CoV-2 virus
BA.2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”) has raised concerns about its potential
impact on public health and personal health as it has
many mutations with respect to previous variants. We conducted
an in silico analysis of neutralizing antibody binding to
BA.2.86. Selected antibodies came from patients who were vaccinated
and/or infected. We predicted binding affinity between
BA.2.86 and antibodies. We also predicted the binding affinity
between the same antibodies and several previous SARS-CoV-
2 variants (Wuhan and Omicron descendants BA.1, BA.2, and
XBB.1.5). Additionally, we examined binding affinity between
BA.2.86 and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor, a cell surface protein crucial for viral entry. We found
no statistically significant difference in binding affinity between
BA.2.86 and other variants, indicating a similar immune response.
These findings contradict media reports of BA.2.86’s
high immune evasion potential based on its mutations. We discuss
the implications of our findings and highlight the need for
modeling and docking studies to go above and beyond mutation
and basic serological neutralization analysis. Future research
in this area will benefit from increased structural analyses of
memory B-cell derived antibodies and should emphasize the importance
of choosing appropriate samples for in silico studies to
assess protection provided by vaccination and infection. This
research contributes to understanding the BA.2.86 variant’s potential
impact on public health. Moreover, we introduce new
methodologies for predictive medicine in ongoing efforts to combat
the evolving SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and prepare for other
hazards.
